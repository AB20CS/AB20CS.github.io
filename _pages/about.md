I am a motivated final year undergraduate student, studying Computer Science and Molecular Biology at the University of Toronto, passionate about machine learning and the applications of technology in biology.

I am currently a Data Science and Clinical Programming Intern at [AstraZeneca](https://www.astrazeneca.com/), where I am building AI-driven tools for clinical data management.
I am also working on computational pathology research co-supervised by [Dr. Rahul G. Krishnan](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html) and Dr. Tony Yeung, studying the spatial organization of immunofluorescent biomarkers in biopsies of patients with AML/MDS.
