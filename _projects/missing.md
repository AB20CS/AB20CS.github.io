A research project completed in Winter 2022, supervised by Dr. Rahul Krishnan at the [Machine Learning and Computational Healthcare Lab](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rahulgk/index.html). Evaluated, through a causal inference perspective, the suboptimality of various imputation methods (such as doubly robust estimators and variational autoencoders) when applied to handle various mechanisms of missingness (i.e., MCAR, MAR and MNAR).
