Medical Clinic is an Android app that allows patients to easily book their own appointments with a doctor that fits their preferences. Doctors are also able to log in and view their schedule and patient information as well as set their weekly availabilities.

This app was developed on Android Studio using Java and data is stored on Firebase. It conforms to SOLID Principles, employing the Model-View-Presenter design. Unit testing was done using JUnit tests and Mockito.
